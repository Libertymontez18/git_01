## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A Mother's breast:  
Safe refuge from her childish fears,  
From childish troubles, childish tears,  
Mists that enshroud her dawning years!  
see how in sleep she seems to sing  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
Ten true friends you have,  
Who, five in a row,  
Upon each side of you  
Go where you go.  
Suppose you are sleepy,  
They help you to bed;  
Suppose you are hungry,  
They see that you are fed.  
They wake up your dolly  
And put on your clothes,  
And trundle her carriage  
Wherever she goes.  
And these ten tiny fellows,  
They serve you with ease;  
And they ask nothing from you,  
But work hard to please.  
Now, with ten willing servants  
So trusty and true,  
Pray who would be lazy  
Or idleâ€”would you?
